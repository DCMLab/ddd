### Digitalizing the dualism debate 

The "dualism debate", a 'hot topic' in 19th-century German music theory, 
is concerned with the mutual relationship of major and minor triads, 
specifically whether the minor triad is a mere derivative of the major triad 
or whether it can be derived from first principles on its own right. 
This project strives to reconstruct and critically evaluate the discursive relations 
within this debate by using the combined power of qualitative-historical 
and quantitative-numerical methods and thus serve to build methodological bridges 
between the humanities and the sciences. The main contribution of this project 
consists in an empirical reconstruction of the discursive structure of the 
dualism debate using network and topic modeling. The project will lead to a 
publicly-available online resource that displays the results of 
the research project and provides access to the data for subsequent research. 

**Time frame:** January - December 2021

**Funding:**

The project is supported by the 
[Collaborative Research on Science and Society (CROSS)](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/cdh/research-2/cross-collaborative-research-on-science-and-society/) 
program, a joint funding scheme between [École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)](https://www.epfl.ch/) 
and [Université de Lausanne (UNIL)](https://www.unil.ch).
