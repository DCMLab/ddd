    <p>​This project requires domain expertise in various academic disciplines: music theory and
historical musicology on the one hand, computer/data science, and natural language processing. The
inherently interdisciplinary nature of the project thus posits it in the center of Digital Humanities research.</p>

<!-- Both Fabian C. Moss and Coline Métrailler possess degrees in musicology and mathematics, and have
extensive experience in natural language processing and data science. The main applicant’s prior work on the
primary source material for this project (Moss, 2012), as well as his more recent work on corpus-based music
studies (e.g. Landnes et al., 2019; Neuwirth et al., 2018; Moss, Neuwirth et al., 2019, Moss, 2019; Moss, Souza
& Rohrmeier, 2020; Lieck et al., in review; Harasim et al., in review) is particularly relevant. The broad
expertise of the second applicant François Bavaud in text processing, corpus statistics, and mathematical
modeling (e.g. Bavaud, 2005, 2020; Bavaud et al., 2015; Ceré & Bavaud, 2019), as well as his experience with
the application of mathematical models to musical data (Cocco & Bavaud, 2015) is instrumental in ensuring
the choice of relevant methods and overall formalisms. Hence, the collective and complementary expertise of
the project team ensures the success of the project. -->
