We woke up this morning with good news in our inboxes: 
The funding for our project "Digitizing the Dualism Debate:
a case study in the computational analysis of historical music sources"
was granted within the scope of the 
[Collaborative Research on Sience and Society](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/cdh/research-2/cross-collaborative-research-on-science-and-society/).

Naturally, we are all very happy about it and are eager to start the project
in January 2021!
