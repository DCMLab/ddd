#### How to display TEI files with TEI-Publisher's web components
1. Upload the file to TEI-Publisher's playground and open it. 
2. Change the ```path``` attribute of the ```<pb-document>``` component to _playground/name_of_file.xml_
    - if there are multiple files in one page, make sure to change ```id``` and ```src``` accordingly.
3. Choose the ODD in the ```odd``` attribute in ```<pb-document>``` - the ODD needs to be created in the TEI-Publisher app.

#### Notes
- sometimes when charging the page, the navigation between pages doesn't appear. Reloading fixes that problem. It doesn't disappear anymore after that. 
- the viewer's footer element conflicts with the site's footer, which is why the navigation in on top of the document.
- [TEI-Publisher's playground area](http://localhost:8081/exist/apps/tei-publisher/index.html?tab=0&collection=playground) is accessible by anyone (login informations are give in the TEI Workshop). Each documents can be deleted by anyone with that access. Is there a better place to store our files ?
